            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p>In a land far away, there lived a wise old owl who knew all the secrets of the forest. One day, a small curious rabbit approached the owl to ask for wisdom.</p>
            <p>The rabbit said, "O wise owl, can you tell me the secret to happiness?" The owl smiled and replied, "Happiness is found in the little things, like a warm day and a friend to share it with."</p>
            <p>From that day on, the rabbit began to appreciate the small joys in life, and soon, happiness followed him wherever he went.</p>
